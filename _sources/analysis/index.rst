Algorithm Analysis
==================
This chapter introduces the motivation, basic notation, and
fundamental techniques of algorithm analysis.
We focus on a methodology known as
:term:`asymptotic algorithm analysis`, or simply
:term:`asymptotic analysis`.
Asymptotic analysis attempts to estimate the resource
consumption of an algorithm.

How long will it take to process the company payroll once we complete
our planned merger?
Should I buy a new payroll program from vendor X or vendor Y?
If a particular program is slow, is it badly implemented or is it
solving a hard problem?
Questions like these ask us to consider the difficulty of a problem,
or the relative efficiency of two or more approaches to solving a
problem.

Asymptotic analysis allows us to compare the relative costs of two or more
algorithms for solving the same problem.
Asymptotic analysis also gives algorithm designers a tool for
estimating whether a proposed solution is likely to meet the resource
constraints for a problem before they implement an actual
program.
After reading this chapter, you should understand

- the concept of a :term:`growth rate`,
  the rate at which the cost of an algorithm grows
  as the size of its input grows;

- the concept of an :term:`upper bound` and :term:`lower bound` for a
  growth rate, and how to estimate these bounds for a simple program,
  algorithm, or problem; and

- the difference between the cost of an :term:`algorithm`
  (or program) and the cost of a :term:`problem`.

The chapter concludes with a brief discussion of the
practical difficulties encountered when empirically measuring the cost
of a program, and some principles for code tuning
to improve program efficiency.
