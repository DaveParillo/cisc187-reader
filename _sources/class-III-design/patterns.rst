Design patterns
===============
A software design pattern is a general, 
reusable solution to a common software problem.
It is not an actual implementation,
but rather an idea.

Design patterns gained popularity in computer science after the book 
*Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software*
was published in 1994 by (Gamma et al.).
The book had 4 authors and together they became known as the
"Gang of Four", or even more briefly the "GoF". 

Design patterns are useful for several reasons:

- They provide useful solutions to common problems
- They provide a common vocabulary between programmers when discussing a design
- They exploit lessons learned by other developers

Fixing an inheritance problem
-----------------------------
Recall our flying penguin problem from the section on :doc:`inheritance`:

.. mermaid::
   :alt: bird inheritance

   classDiagram
      bird <|-- hawk
      bird <|-- owl
      bird <|-- penguin
      bird <|-- robin
      class bird {
         -wingspan double
         +fly() void
         +eat() int
      }

This type of design error is actually common.

It's easy to overlook a design error, in this case flying penguins.
Part of what makes these errors problematic is that design errors
that actually get delivered in the final product are among the most
expensive software errors to fix.

So how do we fix our bird design?

We **could** just override the ``fly`` method for penguins
and have the override do nothing.
This might solve our immediate problem, but it's not a general
solution to this problem:

- It doesn't work as well for non-void functions.
  In this case, ``fly`` -- a void function -- really could do nothing
  A non-void function **must** return something.
  If the function returns something, but that 'something' actually means
  'nothing', then we have another design problem.
  This value now represents a marker that every caller of the function
  might need to handle and understand that no action was taken.
- What happens when we need behaviors other than ``fly``?
  If every time we have an exception case for a derived type
  and we create overrides that do nothing,
  then it can become difficult to understand the true capabilities
  of any object in the hierarchy just by looking that the interface.

  You have to examine the *code* to see how each (or if) an 
  interface was *implemented*.

  Any design that requires us to look at the source code before we can
  completely understand it is not a design we want to use.

Another problem with the existing design is that it encourages
duplication in derived classes.
For example, let's assume we need to model bird flying behavior.
Most birds don't just 'fly'.
They soar, flock, flit about, dive, or don't fly at all.
There are many thousands of different kinds of birds,
but relatively few ways of flying.

We *could* decide to solve this problem using an interface:

.. mermaid::
   :alt: Flying interfaces

   classDiagram
      bird <|-- penguin
      bird <|-- hawk
      bird <|-- owl
      bird <|-- robin
      flyable <|.. hawk
      flyable <|.. owl
      flyable <|.. robin
      class bird {
         -wingspan double
         +eat() int
      }
      class hawk {
         +fly() void
      }
      class owl {
         +fly() void
      }
      class robin {
         +fly() void
      }
      class flyable {
         <<interface>>
         +fly() virtual void
      }

This does allow limiting the flying behavior to those birds that actually fly,
but at a high cost.
Now every bird that *does* fly needs to reimplement the code for ``fly()``.
Derived classes cannot inherit code from each other.
Future maintenance of all the duplicated code could be expensive.
Our current situation:

- Not all birds fly, so inheritance is not the right choice
- A simple interface solves the inheritance problem,
  but creates an unacceptable maintenance burden.

There must be a better option.

   **Accommodating change**

   How can we isolate the parts of a system that change from the parts
   that do not change?
