What if I need help in this class right now?
============================================
You think my book needs help.
I'm sorry to hear that, but I understand this text may not work for everyone.

You need help, what other resources are out there?

First consider your first semester C++ textbook.
It may not cover everything in this course, but it will certainly provide
review of fundamentals if you need that.

Every page in the textbook has a "More to Explore" section with links 
related to the material on that page.
I admit that many of these links are "cppreference.com heavy" and 
*reference* and not exactly a tutorial.
However, the links are still worth checking out,
especially if you are currently reading a page that is giving you trouble.

There is a first semester textbook I am working on for C++.
I trust it as far as it goes, but it is incomplete.

Videos
------
I have a love hate relationship. I can't learn anything from them, but I get everyone learns differently.
Also, it bugs me that people always are trying to sell you something on YouTube.
That said, here are some video sources that I trust.
Some are linked from my textbook:

- Bucky's C++ Tutorials: 
  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAE85DE8440AA6B83
- My Code School C++ Pointers: 
  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2_aWCzGMAwLZp6LMUKI3cc7pgGsasm2_
  There is a C playlist that has a lot to offer: 
  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2_aWCzGMAwLSqGsERZGXGkA5AfMhcknE
- The Cherno is a game developer from Australia with a C++ channel: 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18c3MTX0PK0


- Jason Turner C++ weekly: https://www.youtube.com/user/lefticus1/videos

  - These are a bit more random as opposed to a linear tutorial, but this guy is incredibly smart.
    But this is an area where you really do not want to try to see them all.
    It may be too overwhelming and some advanced concepts are mixed in with the basics.
    Just try one on for size and if it isn't helping, then forget it.

All these videos are usually short, single topic tutorials.

Other resources
---------------

I highly recommend trying out excerism.io.
You can solve simple problems in C++ and many other languages too.
The problems are designed like a ladder with gradually increasing difficulty.


If you learn of anything particularly useful to you, please share!
