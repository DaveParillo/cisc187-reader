Self Check
===========
The questions in this section provide a chance to demonstrate
your understanding of the concepts discussed so far.

After reading the material in this chapter,
you should be able to answer these questions.

.. fillintheblank:: begin_fitb1

   Given the following plain english statements:

   - Create a variable x with value 8
   - Create a variable y with value 5
   - Add x and y, storing the result in y

   If they were implemented as a program,
   then what value is ``y`` when finished? 

   - :13: Correct.
     :5: No, because the variable y is modified.
     :8: No. ``y`` is the sum of x and y, not simply ``x``.
     :x: Try again.

   Place these statements in their proper order
   so that the program prompts for input, computes the area,
   and displays the results.

.. fillintheblank:: begin_fitb2

   Given the following program:

   .. code-block:: cpp
      :linenos:

      int main() {
        int a = 7;
        int b = 4;

        if (a<=b) { 
          a = 99;
        } else {    
          int t = a;
          a = b;

        return a;                                     
      }

   What value is returned? 

   - :4: Correct.
     :7: No, because the variable a is always modified in this program.
     :99: No. Since a is greater than b, the code on line 6 is never executed.
     :.*: Sorry, no. What is happening in the else block?

   Which of the following statements represent **assignment to** a variable?  Check all that apply.

  :feedback_c: A variable may not start with a number
  :feedback_d: A variable can't contain spaces or most special characters

  Which of the following are legal variable names? Check all that apply.

   :correct: e
   :feedback_a: This code subtracts one from x, adds one to y, and then sets z to to the value in z plus the current value of y.
   :feedback_b: This code subtracts one from x, adds one to y, and then sets z to to the value in z plus the current value of y.
   :feedback_c: This code subtracts one from x, adds one to y, and then sets z to to the value in z plus the current value of y.

   :feedback_e: This code subtracts one from x, adds one to y, and then sets z to to the value in z plus the current value of y.

   What are the values of x, y, and z after the following code executes?

   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: This would be the result of 158 divided by 10.  Modulus gives you the remainder.
   :feedback_b: Modulus gives you the remainder after the division.
   :feedback_c: When you divide 158 by 10 you get a remainder of 8.  

   What is the result of 158 % 10?

.. mchoice:: begin_mc_mod_2
   :answer_a: 3
   :answer_b: 2
   :answer_c: 8
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: 8 goes into 3 no times so the remainder is 3.  The remainder of a smaller number divided by a larger number is always the smaller number!
   :feedback_b: This would be the remainder if the question was 8 % 3 but here we are asking for the reminder after we divide 3 by 8.
   :feedback_c: What is the remainder after you divide 3 by 8?  

   What is the result of 3 % 8?

   :answer_d: x = 4, y = 2.5, z = 3
   :answer_e: x = 6, y = 2, z = 3
   :correct: e
   :feedback_a: This code sets x to z * 2 (6), y to y divided by 2 (5 / 2 = 2) and z = to z + 1 (2 + 1 = 3).
   :feedback_b: This code sets x to z * 2 (6), y must be an int, z is incremented
   :feedback_c: This code sets x to z * 2 (6),
   :feedback_d: This code sets x to z * 2 (6), y must be an int
   :feedback_e: Correct

   What are the values of x, y, and z after the following code executes?

   .. code-block:: java 
 
      int x = 3;
      int y = 5;

.. fillintheblank:: begin_fitb3

   Given the following statement:

   .. code-block:: cpp

      double x = 2 + 2^3
 
   What is value stored in ``x``? 

   - :7: Correct.
     :10: No. ``^`` is not the exponent operator.
          There is no such operator in C++.
          It is the *exclusive or* operator.
     :64: No. ``^`` is not the exponent operator.
          There is no such operator in C++.
          It is the *exclusive or* operator.
     :3: No. The spaces here are misleading.
         Addition has higher precedence than exclusive or.
     :x: Try again.
