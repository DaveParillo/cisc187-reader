Strategy pattern
================
We can think of flying as a *strategy* different birds employ to move around.
Birds don't *inherit* a fly behavior, they *have it*.
The centerpiece of the solution is to isolate many different
types of flying behavior behind a single class that stores
a pointer to a function implementing the behavior.
Each implementation defines a different **strategy** for the interface.

.. mermaid::
   :alt: Flying strategy

   classDiagram
      class fly_behavior {
         -strategy std::function~void()~
         +fly() void
      }

Any callable entity (function, function object, or lambda) is
a potential strategy that derived classes of a bird can now use.

.. code-block:: cpp

   #include <iostream>
   #include <functional>
   #include <utility>

   #define FunctionObject typename 

   // an alias to avoid copying std::function<void()> everywhere
   using fly_strategy = std::function<void()>;

   class fly_behavior {
     public:
       template<FunctionObject F>
       explicit fly_behavior(F strategy) 
         : strategy {strategy}
       { }

       void fly() { strategy(); }

     private:
       fly_strategy strategy;
   };

   // a function object that implements a strategy
   struct soar
   {
     void operator() () {
      std::cout << "fly by soaring.\n";
     }
   };

   // a free function can also implement a strategy
   void no_flying_allowed() {
     std::cout << "I don't fly.\n";
   }


The base class now *delgates* the fly behavior to the strategy
instead of either defining a single fixed behavior or forcing every
derived class to create one.
In languages without lambda expressions, each implemented strategy
is usually implemented as a separate class, each inheriting from the base
strategy class.
In C++, an inheritance based solution is possible, but not required.
There is no 'best' solution - your needs must drive the final
design decision.
In general, if the strategy also needs to store state information,
then implement as a class or function object.
If the strategy is stateless, then implement a functional solution.

.. code-block:: cpp

   class bird {
     fly_strategy strategy = soar();

     public:
     bird () = default;
     explicit bird(fly_strategy strategy)
      : strategy(strategy)
     {}
     ~bird () = default;

     // change strategy mid-stream
     void fly_behavior (fly_strategy new_strategy) {
      strategy = new_strategy;
     }

     void fly() {
      strategy();
     }
   };

In this example, a bird may

- default construct the default soaring strategy, or
- set a strategy when constructed, or
- change the strategy at some point after construction.

An example of birds using the strategy:

.. code-block:: cpp

   // a hawk can use the default soar behavior
   class hawk : public bird {
     public:
      hawk() = default;
   };

   // this penguin defines its fly behavior using a free function
   class penguin : public bird {
     public:
      penguin()
        : bird(no_flying_allowed)
      {}
   };

   int main() {
     hawk h;
     h.fly();

     penguin p;
     p.fly();

     // change the behavior for just this penguin
     p.fly_behavior(
        [](){ 
         std::cout << "With a rocket pack, now I can fly!!\n";
        }
     );
     p.fly();

     return 0;
   }

Notice that we fixed our inheritance problem by using :term:`composition`.
Not only did composition allow us to encapsulate a family of behaviors,
it also allowed a simple hook to enable changing the behavior at runtime.
