.. index:: namespace

Namespaces
==========
When we introduced functions, we noted that all functions are *by default* global.
Another way of saying this is that they are by default in the *global namespace*.
The ``namespace`` keyword provides a mechanism
to avoid polluting the global namespace with too many names.


A ``namespace`` is simply a named block that defines a scope.
Namespaces provide a method for preventing name conflicts in large projects.

Symbols declared inside a namespace block are placed in a named scope that prevents them from being mistaken for identically-named symbols in other scopes.

Multiple namespace blocks with the same name are allowed. 
All declarations within those blocks are declared in the named scope.

.. code-block:: cpp

   // declare some things in the mesa namespace
   namespace mesa {
     int i = 0;
     double pi = 3.1416;
     void details (char);
   }

   void mesa::details (char c) { // define the function declared earlier
     // do something
   }

   //void mesa::oops () {       // error: oops not yet declared in mesa namespace
   //}

   namespace mesa {  // a separate mesa namespace block
     void oops ();
     namespace cisc {
       double pi = 3.14159265358979;  // not the same variable as mesa::pi
     }
   }

   int main () {
     using mesa::cisc::pi;
     pi = 3.f;
     mesa::details('a');
   }

   

The larger your project, the more important it is to partition the global namespace.
By default, all symbols are declared in the *global namespace* (``::``).

What is the problem with the global namespace?

- There is only 1 of them
- Name conflicts can be common on large projects
- Complicates mixing third party libraries

Well-behaved third party libraries will not put much (if anything) in the global namespace.

You can put anything in a namespace, except ``main``.
The function main has a few special rules and one is that it must be in the global namespace.

The ``using`` directive allows all the names in a namespace to be used 
without the namespace-name as an explicit qualifier. 
Use a using directive in an implementation file (i.e. ``*.cpp``) 
if you are using several different identifiers in a namespace; 
if you are just using one or two identifiers, 
then consider a using declaration to only bring those identifiers into scope 
and not all the identifiers in the namespace. 
If a local variable has the same name as a namespace variable, 
the namespace variable is hidden. 
It is an error to have a namespace variable with the same name as a global variable.


.. index::
   pair: namespace; using directive

Prefer using declarations to ``using namespace std``
----------------------------------------------------
What's wrong with ``using namespace std;``?

Nothing, technically.
It was a simplification in your first semester classes.
The intent was to avoid 'burdening' you with having to care about this technical detail.

**BUT**

The using-directive ``using namespace std;`` at any namespace scope introduces 
*every* name from the namespace std into the global namespace 
(since the global namespace is the nearest namespace that contains both std and any user-declared namespace), 
which may lead to undesirable name collisions. 
This, and other using directives are generally considered bad practice at file scope of a header file.
Additionally, shadowing names in the standard namespace can lead to unexpected behaviors.


.. tabbed:: namespace

   .. tab:: Example: namespace std

      It can be hard to remember every name that might be
      imported when ``using namespace std;``.
      Even when only 1 header is included.

      The following example seems innocent enough,
      until you learn that :io:`showpoint<manip/showpoint>` is a name
      in ``std::ios``

      Run the following example twice,
      first as is, then remove the line ``bool showpoint = true;``:

      .. activecode:: ac_using_namespace_std_1
         :language: cpp
         :nocodelens:

         #include <iostream>

         using namespace std;

         int main () {
           bool showpoint = true; 

           cout << "1.0 with showpoint: " << showpoint << 1.0 << '\n'
                << "1.0 with noshowpoint: " << noshowpoint << 1.0 << '\n';

         }
   
Errors using namespace directives are seldom this obviously wrong.


.. tabbed:: so_question

   .. tab:: Stack Overflow

      Here is a simplification of a 
      `real question <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2712076/how-to-use-an-iterator>`_
      asked on stack overflow:

      .. activecode:: ac_using_namespace_std_so_2
         :language: cpp
         :compileargs: ['-Wall', '-Wextra', '-std=c++20']

         #include <iostream>
         #include <vector>
         #include <cmath>
         using namespace std;

         struct point {
           float x;
           float y;
         };

         // calculate the distance between two points
         float distance(const point& p1, const point& p2) {
           return sqrt((p1.x - p2.x)*(p1.x - p2.x) +
                       (p1.y - p2.y)*(p1.y - p2.y));
         }

         int main() {
           vector <point> po;
           point p1; p1.x = 0; p1.y = 0;
           point p2; p2.x = 100; p2.y = 100;
           po.push_back(p1);
           po.push_back(p2);

           for (auto ii = po.begin(); ii != po.end(); ii++) {
             for (auto jj = po.begin(); jj != po.end(); jj++) {
               cout << distance(ii,jj) << " ";
             }
           }
           return 0;
         }
             
            
      This code compiles and runs and says the answer is: ``0 1 -1 0``.
      I think we can all agree that is not the correct answer for two points ``(0,0)`` and ``(100,100)``.

.. admonition:: Try This!

   What is wrong with the program?

   Can you fix it?

   **Hint:**

   This section is about *namespaces*.


.. index::
   pair: Herb Sutter; namespace using
   pair: Andrei Alexandrescu; namespace using

One final word from two experts:

  **Summary**

  Namespace usings are for your convenience, not for you to inflict on others: 
  Never write a ``using`` declaration or a ``using`` directive before an ``#include`` directive.

  Corollary: In header files, 
  donâ€™t write namespace-level using directives or using declarations; 
  instead, explicitly namespace-qualify all names. 
  (The second rule follows from the first, 
  because headers can never know what other header ``#include`` might appear after them.)

  **Discussion**

  In short: 
  You can and should use namespace using declarations and directives liberally 
  in your implementation files after ``#include`` directives and feel good about it. 
  Despite repeated assertions to the contrary, 
  namespace ``using`` declarations and directives are not evil and they do not defeat the purpose of namespaces. 
  Rather, they are what make namespaces usable.
