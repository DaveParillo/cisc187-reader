   single: iterable types

Iterable ADT's
==============
How can we visit each :term:`element` in a :term:`container`
and remain ignorant of the underlying container implementation details?
For example, given:

.. code-block:: cpp

   array<string, 3> names = {"Alice", "Bob", "Clara"};
   std::list<int>   ages  = {27, 3, 1};

What options do we have for operating on each :term:`element` in ``names`` and ``ages``?
A traditional :lang:`for` or :lang:`while` loop works for ``names``:

.. code-block:: cpp

   for (unsigned i=0; i < names.size(); ++i) {
     cout << names[i] << '\n';
   }

   unsigned i = 0;
   while(i < names.size()) {
     cout << names[i++] << '\n';
   }

However, this code does not compile:

.. code-block:: cpp

   for (unsigned i=0; i < ages.size(); ++i) {
     cout << ages[i] << '\n';
   }

   unsigned i = 0;
   while(i < ages.size()) {
     cout << ages[i++] << '\n';
   }

Traditional loops using an ``int`` index do not work with containers
that do not overload ``operator[]``.
Containers in this category include 
:container:`list`,
:container:`set`, and
:container:`map`.

We solve this problem by avoiding explicit indexing altogether.
The :lang:`range-based for loop <range-for>` 
provides a more readable equivalent to the traditional for loop:

.. code-block:: cpp
   
   for (string s: names) {
     cout << s << '\n';
   }

   // better: avoids copying
   for (const auto& s: names) {
     cout << s << '\n';
   }

The same syntax can be used for any STL container:
   
.. code-block:: cpp

   std::list<int>  ages  = {27, 3, 1};

   for (const auto& a: ages) {
     cout << a.first << ' ' << a.second << '\n';
   }

When you need to loop over each element in a collection,
the :lang:`range-for` loop has completely
abstracted away the idea of moving from one element to the next.

We say these containers are :term:`iterable`.
