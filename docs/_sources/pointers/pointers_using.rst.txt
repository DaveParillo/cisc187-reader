Using pointers
==============
The simplest way to use a pointer is to get their value as with any other variable. 
This value will be an address, 
which can be stored in another pointer variable of the same type.

.. code-block:: cpp

   int n = 2;
   int* p = &n;  // points to n
   int* q = p;   // points to n also


Once a pointer has been dereferenced, it is treated exactly like any other variable of that type.

.. code-block:: cpp

   *p = *p + *q; // n = 4

The ``*`` operator binds very tightly, in other words,
is it has high *precedence*.
You can usually use ``*p`` anywhere you could use the variable it points to 
without worrying about parentheses. 
However, a few operators, 
such as the unary decrement and increment (``--`` and ``++``) operators, 
and the member of (``.``) operator used to unpack structs and classes, 
all have higher precedence. 
These require parentheses if you want the ``*`` to take precedence.

   #include <iostream>
   int main() {
     int n = 2;
     int* p = &n;  // points to n
     int* q = p;   // points to n also
     *p = *p + *q; // n = 4
     std::cout << "n = " << n << '\n';
     
     int* p2n = &n;  // another pointer to n
     (*p)++; // increments n
     std::cout << "n = " << n << '\n';
     std::cout << "* p = " << * p << '\n';
     *p++;   // increments p
             // p now points to next address in memory
             // Almost always an error
     std::cout << "* p = " << * p << '\n';

     return 0;
   }

Unlike the fundamental types in C++,
pointer types do not implicitly convert to other types.
While we expect to be able to assign an int to a double,
it is a compile error to assign an int pointer to a double pointer:

.. code-block:: cpp
   
   int    i = 5;
   double d = i;     // OK.  implicit widening conversion

   int*    pi = &i;
   double* di = pi;  // compile error
