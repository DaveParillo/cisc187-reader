Insertion sort
==============
What would you do if you have a stack of phone bills from the past
two years and you want to order by date?
A fairly natural way to handle this is to look at the first two
bills and put them in order.
Then take the third bill and put it into the right position with
respect to the first two, and so on.
As you take each bill, you would add it to the sorted pile that you
have already made.
This simple approach is the inspiration for
our first sorting algorithm, called **Insertion Sort**.

Insertion Sort iterates through a list of records.
For each iteration, the current record is inserted in turn at the
correct position within a sorted list composed of those records
already processed.
Given an array named ``data`` that stores :math:`n` records,
one way to implement an insertion sort could be this.

.. code-block:: cpp

   template <class Comparable>
   void insertion_sort(Comparable* data[], int n) {
     for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
       for (int j = i; (j > 0) && (*data[j] < *data[j-1]); --j) {
         swap(data, j, j-1);
        }
      }
   }

This sort is still :math:`O(n^{2})`, but works differently from
the bubble sort and selection sort, since
it always maintains a sorted subvector in the container.
Each new item is then "inserted" back into
the previous subvector such that the sorted subvector is one item larger.
:ref:`Figure 4 <fig_insertionsort>` shows the insertion sorting process. 
The shaded items represent the ordered subvectors as the
algorithm makes each pass.


.. _fig_insertionsort:

.. figure:: figures/insertionsort.png
   :align: center

   Figure 4: ``Insertion Sort``


We begin by assuming that a vector with one item (position :math:`0`) is
already sorted. On each pass, one for each item 1 through :math:`n-1`,
the current item is checked against those in the already sorted subvector.
As we look back into the already sorted subvector, we shift those items
that are greater to the right. When we reach a smaller item or the end
of the subvector, the current item can be inserted.

:ref:`Figure 5 <fig_insertionpass>` shows the fifth pass in detail. At this point in
the algorithm, a sorted subvector of five items consisting of 17, 26, 54,
77, and 93 exists. We want to insert 31 back into the already sorted
items. The first comparison against 93 causes 93 to be shifted to the
right. 77 and 54 are also shifted. When the item 26 is encountered, the
shifting process stops and 31 is placed in the open position. Now we
have a sorted subvector of six items.

.. tabbed:: lst_insertion_sort

   .. tab:: Insertion Sort

      The implementation of ``insertion_sort`` 
      (:ref:`ActiveCode 1 <lst_insertion_cpp>`) shows that
      there are again :math:`n-1` passes to sort *n* items. The iteration
      starts at position 1 and moves through position :math:`n-1`, as these
      are the items that need to be inserted back into the sorted subvectors.
      Line 8 performs the shift operation that moves a value up one position
      in the vector, making room behind it for the insertion.
      Remember that this
      is not a complete exchange as was performed in the previous algorithms.

      The maximum number of comparisons for an insertion sort is the sum of
      the first :math:`n-1` integers. Again, this is :math:`O(n^{2})`.
      However, in the best case, only one comparison needs to be done on each
      pass. This would be the case for an already sorted vector.

      One note about shifting versus exchanging is also important. In general,
      a shift operation requires approximately a third of the processing work
      of an exchange since only one assignment is performed. In benchmark
      studies, insertion sort will show very good performance.

             int position = index;

             while (position>0 && data[position-1]>currentvalue) {

               --position;

             std::cout << value << ' ';

           std::cout << '\n';

**Self Check**

         :correct: c
         :answer_a: [4, 5, 12, 15, 14, 10, 8, 18, 19, 20]
         :answer_b: [15, 5, 4, 10, 12, 8, 14, 18, 19, 20]
         :answer_c: [4, 5, 15, 18, 12, 19, 14, 10, 8, 20]
         :answer_d: [15, 5, 4, 18, 12, 19, 14, 8, 10, 20]
         :feedback_a: This is the result of bubble sort.
         :feedback_b: This is the result of selection sort.
         :feedback_c: Insertion sort works at the start of the list.  Each pass produces a longer sorted list.
         :feedback_d: Insertion sort works on the front of the list not the end.

         Suppose you have the following list of numbers to sort:
         [15, 5, 4, 18, 12, 19, 14, 10, 8, 20] which list represents the partially sorted list after three complete passes of insertion sort?

Costs of Exchange Sorting
=========================
The running time for each of the sorts discussed so far is
:math:`\Theta(n^2)` in the average and worst cases.
The cost summary for the Insertion Sort,
Bubble Sort, and Selection Sort in terms of their required number of
comparisons and swaps in the best, average, and worst cases is shown.

.. math::

   \begin{array}{rccc}
   &\textbf{Insertion}&\textbf{Bubble}&\textbf{Selection}\\
   \textbf{Comparisons:}\\
   \textrm{Best Case}&\Theta(n)&\Theta(n^2)&\Theta(n^2)\\
   \textrm{Average Case}&\Theta(n^2)&\Theta(n^2)&\Theta(n^2)\\
   \textrm{Worst Case}&\Theta(n^2)&\Theta(n^2)&\Theta(n^2)\\
   \\
   \textbf{Swaps:}\\
   \textrm{Best Case}&0&0&\Theta(n)\\
   \textrm{Average Case}&\Theta(n^2)&\Theta(n^2)&\Theta(n)\\
   \textrm{Worst Case}&\Theta(n^2)&\Theta(n^2)&\Theta(n)\\
   \end{array}

The remaining sorting algorithms presented in this chapter are
significantly better than these three under typical conditions.
But before continuing on, it is instructive to investigate what makes
these three sorts so slow.
The crucial bottleneck is that only *adjacent* records are compared.
Thus, comparisons and moves (for Insertion and Bubble Sort) are by
single steps.
Swapping adjacent records is called an :term:`exchange`.
Thus, these sorts are sometimes referred to as an *exchange sort*.
The cost of any exchange sort can be at best the total number of
steps that the records in the array must move to reach their
"correct" location.
Recall that this is at least the number of
inversions for the record. An :index:`inversion` occurs when a
record with key value greater than the current record's key value
appears before it.
