Merge sort
==========
We now turn our attention to using a :term:`divide and conquer` strategy as a
way to improve the performance of sorting algorithms. The first
algorithm we will study is the **merge sort**. Merge sort is a recursive
algorithm that continually splits a vector in half. If the vector is empty
or has one item, it is sorted by definition (the base case). If the vector
has more than one item, we split the vector and recursively invoke a merge
sort on both halves. Once the two halves are sorted, the fundamental
operation, called a **merge**, is performed. Merging is the process of
taking two smaller sorted vectors and combining them together into a
single, sorted, new vector. :ref:`Figure 10 <fig_mergesortA>` shows our familiar example
vector as it is being split by ``mergeSort``. :ref:`Figure 11 <fig_mergesortB>` shows
the simple vectors, now sorted, as they are merged back together.

      The ``merge_sort`` function begins by checking the base case.
      If the length of the vector is less than or equal to one, 
      then we already have a sorted vector and no more processing is needed.
      If the length is greater than one,
      then we extract the left and right halves.
      It is important to note that the vector may not have an even
      number of items. That does not matter, as the lengths will differ by at
      most one.

      Once the ``merge_sort`` function is invoked on the left half and the
      right half (lines 23â€“24), it is assumed they are sorted. The rest of the
      function is responsible for merging the two smaller sorted
      vectors into a larger sorted vector. Notice that the merge operation places
      the items back into the original vector (``data``) one at a time by
      repeatedly taking the smallest item from the sorted vectors.

      The print function shows the vector contents at the start of
      each invocation. There is also a print call at the end to show
      the merging process. The output shows the result of executing the
      function on our example vector. 
      
      Note that the vector with 44, 55, and 20
      will not divide evenly. The first split gives [44] and the second gives
      [55,20]. It is easy to see how the splitting process eventually yields a
      vector that can be immediately merged with other sorted vectors.

In order to analyze the ``merge_sort`` function, we need to consider the
two distinct processes that make up its implementation. 
First, the vector is split into halves.
We already computed (in a binary search) that we can divide a vector in half 
:math:`\log n` times where *n* is the length of the vector.
The second process is the merge.
Each item in the vector will eventually be processed and 
placed on the sorted vector. 
So the merge operation which results in a vector of size *n* requires *n*
operations. 
The result of this analysis is that :math:`\log n` splits,
each of which costs :math:`n` for a total of :math:`n\log n` operations. 
A merge sort is an :math:`O(n \cdot log n)` algorithm and even better,
it is also :math:`\Omega(n \cdot log n)` in the worst case.


Recall that the slicing operator is :math:`O(k)` where k is the size
of the slice. In order to guarantee that ``merge_sort`` will be
:math:`O(n \cdot log n)` we will need to remove the slice operator. Again,
this is possible if we simply pass the starting and ending indices along
with the vector when we make the recursive call. We leave this as an
exercise.

It is important to notice that the ``merge_sort`` function requires extra
space to hold the two halves as they are extracted with the slicing
operations. This additional space can be a critical factor if the vector
is large and can make this sort problematic when working on large data sets.
